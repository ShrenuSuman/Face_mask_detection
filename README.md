# Face_mask_detection
Developed and implemented a deep learning model for face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Gathered and preprocessed a large dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks.
Created separate training, testing, and validation datasets for training and evaluating the model's performance.
Trained the CNN model on the training dataset to learn patterns and features for accurate mask detection.
Utilized transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet for improved performance.
Fine-tuned the model by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Implemented data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset.
Conducted extensive experimentation and analysis to optimize the model's accuracy, precision, and recall.
Collaborated with a team of developers and researchers to enhance the overall performance and reliability of the system.
Evaluated the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
