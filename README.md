# Face_mask_detection
Dataset Preparation:

Collect a dataset of images containing people with and without masks. This dataset should be labeled with appropriate annotations indicating whether each person is wearing a mask or not.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Data Preprocessing:

Resize the images to a fixed size, e.g., 224x224 pixels, to ensure consistent input dimensions for the CNN model.
Normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Perform data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase the dataset size and improve model generalization.
Model Architecture:

Build a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
A common approach is to use a pre-trained CNN as the backbone and add custom layers on top for classification.
Freeze the pre-trained layers initially and only train the custom layers to avoid overfitting, unless you have a large dataset.
Training:

Compile the model with an appropriate loss function, such as binary cross-entropy, and an optimizer, like Adam or RMSprop.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Monitor the training process by tracking metrics like accuracy and loss.


Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recallto measure the model's performance.
Adjust the model and hyperparameters as needed based on the evaluation results.
